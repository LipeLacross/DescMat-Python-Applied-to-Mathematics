## üõ†Ô∏è Running the Project

To start the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Python is Installed**:
    - [Python](https://www.python.org/) is required to run the notebooks. Check if Python is installed with:
      ```bash
      python --version
      ```
    - If not installed, download and install the recommended version.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
    - Copy the repository URL and run the following command in the terminal:
      ```bash
      git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
      ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    - Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies with:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

4. **Open the Notebooks**:
    - Use Jupyter Notebook to open and run the `.ipynb` files:
      ```bash
      jupyter notebook
      ```

## üåê Deploy

The project does not have a specific deployment phase as it is intended for learning and local practice. Follow the steps above to set up and run the project in your local environment.
